# ScammerHarasser
A simple program I wrote to harass scammers with Twilio Call Service.  I got very sick of scammers calling me about "My windows computer" or telling me that they were my grandson and needed money to "Get home".  So I wrote a worte a program using Twilio's Python interface that allows you to infinitely call a number.  

Idea and basic code outline for placing calls came from a python twilio interfacing tutorial.

NOTE: FREE VERSION ONLY WORKS WITH VERIFIED NUMBERS. PAID VERSION ALLOWS CALLING OF ANY NUMBER.  WORKING ON A SKYPE VERSION NOW.
